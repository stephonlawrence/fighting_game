## Game Details
This will be a fighting game. Combat will be similar to super smash bros but with characters, abilities, and attacks more akin to God of War, Vikings (the show), or Dark Souls.

I know these are 3D games/shows referenced but I'm sure something could come from mixing the idea of super smash bros and these great movies/shows.

Story, characters, and abilities should be thought of with Norse mythology in mind.

* learn about ECS by implementing my own system
* learn main components of animation systems
* practice and learn how to build combat systems in 2d

### Later
* AI adapting to player level of play
